# Turning an Observable into a Promise
### [Angular 2 Fundamentals]("https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/angular2-fundamentals") Practice Exercise


**_Instructions_**: This project contains a parent component with a button, and 
properties for an observable, a promise, and the result of the promise.
The observable should be turned into a promise. When the button is clicked, 
it will listen to the promise and display the result. A success message will
appear if the result is correct.


To Do This:

1. In the ngOnInit event handler, turn "this.observable" into a promise
2. Assign this promise to the "this.promise" property
