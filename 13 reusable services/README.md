# Creating and Injecting Services
### [Angular 2 Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/angular2-fundamentals) Practice Exercise

**_Instructions_**: The data for the events-list component is currently hard-coded in the component. Create
a service to hold this data and return it from a getEvents() method on the service. To do this you will need to:

1. Create the service and register it in the model.

1. Remove the data from the component and then inject and call the service to get the data.

**_When you're done, be sure to run the Plunk and you should see your events displayed in the table on the page._**
