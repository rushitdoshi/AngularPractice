**_Instructions_**: This project contains a parent component with a single button.
When the button is pressed, the client should make a GET request to the 
following Url: "http://swapi.co/api/films/", and then assign the returned 
data's "results" property to the movieList property of the component.
This will display the data on the page.


To Do This:

1. issue the get call from the http object with the given Url.
2. map the returned response and convert the json to javascript
3. subscribe to the resulting observable and assign the results property to the movieList property
