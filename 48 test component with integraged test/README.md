### [Angular 2 Fundamentals]("https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/angular2-fundamentals") Practice Exercise


**_Instructions_**: The movie.service.spec.ts file contains a test to check 
the that the movies component displays all the movies in its list. Complete the 
test and the test setup so that the test will run correctly. There are 3 missing
pieces.


To Do This:

1. add the component under test to the components list for the test module
2. create the component in the callback for the "compileComponents" method
3. in the test, you need to initiate change detection for the component so that the template will be rendered and bound
