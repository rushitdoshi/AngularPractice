# Use the useExisting  Provider
### [Angular 2 Fundamentals]("https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/angular2-fundamentals") Practice Exercise


**_Instructions_**: This project contains a parent component, a logger service, and a simple logger service.
Make the system use the logger service whenever anyone asks for a simple logger service, so that they get 
a simplified interface, but still get the full implementation. The solution is right if when you press the button
you see a message logged out to the console.

To Do This:

1. register the Logger service as a provider
2. use the useExisting provider to provide the Logger service in place of the simple logger service
