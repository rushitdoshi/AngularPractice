### [Angular 2 Fundamentals]("https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/angular2-fundamentals") Practice Exercise


**_Instructions_**: This project contains a home component (app/home.component.ts) and a multi slot component
(app/multi-slot.component.ts). The home component uses the multi slot component and puts content into three
different projection slots. Create the multi-slot component, and wrap the content in the first slot in a 
red border, the content in the second slot in a blue border, and the content in the third slot in a green
border. To do this:


1. Give the multi-slot component a template that contains a wrapping div with the class of `well`
2. Create three divs with the correct color borders.
3. Inside each of those three divs, add the ng-content tag with the correct select attribute
