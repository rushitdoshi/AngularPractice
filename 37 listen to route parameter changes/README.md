# Listening to Route Parameter Changes
### [Angular 2 Fundamentals]("https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/angular2-fundamentals") Practice Exercise


**_Instructions_**: This project contains a movies component which is a routed component 
and includes an id parameter. The id corresponds to the current movie in the movie db.
There are also links to the same route with a different id at the top of the component.
Your task is to implement the On Init method so that the component listens to the route 
parameters, and displays the current movie


To Do This:

1. Create an observer on the activated route's params in the on init method
2. Set the currentMovie property of the component to the correct move in the array that matches the id
