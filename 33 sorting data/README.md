There are two buttons, one for sorting the list by rating ascending, one for sorting it descending.
Implement the methods for the buttons so that the movie list is sorted correctly.
To Do This:

1. call the array's sort method. this method has 1 parameter which is a function with 2 parameters, each a movie.
2. in the ascending sort method, compare the movies ratings, and return either a positive number if the first rating comes before the second, a zero if the ratings are the same, or a negative number if the second rating comes after the first
3. implement the opposite method for the descending order
